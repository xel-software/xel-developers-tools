#### Xel dApp chat v 0.1

It’s a Private Chat dApp build on the XEL platform.

The idea is to send encrypted messages with 0.1 fee which will never be recorded on the blockchain.

That’s means messages are gone after deadlines(30 mins by default) — they are Burning. :)

But for chatting that’s quite enough, and it even brings some advantages:

* Messages are instant, depending on the speed of broadcasting. It no longer depends on blocktime.
* No one can dig through your chat history or steal your messages — everything is gone after the deadlines.
* An account with a verified public key is the only thing you need.
